# Description

The **Greek-Multimodal-Speech-Dataset-Corpus-v1** is a comprehensive dataset designed for research and development in multimodal machine learning, speech recognition, and accessibility technologies. This dataset focuses on the Greek language and provides high-quality, synchronized data across three modalities:

- **Speech**: High-resolution audio recordings of spoken Greek.
- **Lip Movement**: Video recordings capturing detailed lip movements for lip-sync and speech alignment tasks.
- **Subtitles**: Accurate text transcriptions and timestamps synchronized with audio and video.

### Suitable for Tasks Such As:
- Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
- Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR)
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) applications
- Accessibility tools for the deaf and hard of hearing
- Multimodal sentiment analysis and natural language processing

### Key Features:
- **Language**: Greek (Hellenic)
- **Format**: Includes `.wav` for audio, `.mp4` for video, and `.srt/.json` for subtitles and timestamps.
- **High Quality**: Captured in a professional studio environment for maximum clarity and precision.
- **Accessibility**: Designed with a focus on inclusivity and use in accessibility research.

### Versioning
This is version **1.0** of the dataset. Future versions may include additional speakers, dialects, or extended annotations.
